🏏 Virat Kohli Career Performance Dashboard
A dynamic, interactive data visualization project designed to provide an in-depth statistical analysis of the international cricket career of Virat Kohli.

🎯 Short Description / Purpose
This Power BI dashboard offers a compelling and comprehensive exploration of Virat Kohli's batting statistics across all formats (Tests, ODIs, T20Is). It is engineered to help cricket analysts, media houses, coaches, and fans quickly examine career milestones, compare performance against various opponents and conditions, and identify historical trends in his game.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – The main platform used for designing the interactive data model and developing the visual report interface.

📂 Power Query (M Language) – Employed for connecting to and efficiently transforming the raw historical cricket data, ensuring data integrity and structure before loading.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Crucial for creating advanced calculated measures and key performance indicators (KPIs), such as Average, Strike Rate, Conversion Rates, and Performance Index.

📝 Data Modeling – Structured relationships between tables (e.g., Match Data, Innings Records, Opponents) to allow fluid cross-filtering and accurate aggregation of statistics.

📁 File Format – Developed and shared as a Power BI Report file (.pbix).

💾 Data Source
The project relies on publicly available, comprehensive historical cricket data.

Source: Official ICC Records, ESPNcricinfo, and Cricket Statistic Repositories (Hypothetical)

Data Content: Data spanning Virat Kohli's entire international career, potentially including over 500+ matches with details on:

Match Performance: Scores, minutes batted, boundaries (4s/6s), strike rate, and dismissal type.

Contextual Variables: Opponent, host country, ground/venue, match format (Test, ODI, T20I), and result of the match.

Time Series Data: Date, series name, and year of the match for trend analysis.

✨ Features / Highlights
The primary goal of the dashboard is to provide clear, statistical insights into one of cricket's most prolific batsmen.

Business Problem Analyzing a player's performance across different formats, decades, and playing conditions usually requires manually aggregating disparate data sources. This raw data makes it difficult for analysts to quickly identify shifts in form, weak spots, or specific strengths.

Goal of the Dashboard To provide a single source of truth for Kohli's statistics that is easy to navigate, supports quick comparisons, and delivers meaningful insights into the evolution of his game.
